# Contributing

Here are a few simple guidelines to follow if you wish to contribute:


- **Submit an Issue** (mark as "Other") describing what you intend to implement. Allow me time to provide feedback so that there is less risk of rework or rejection.
- New endpoints should be accompanied by a **relevant test case**.
- I try to maintain a **small dependency footprint**. If you intend to add a new dependency, make sure that there is a strong case for it.
- Run ``flake8 --max-line-length=120`` on your changes before pushing.
- **Please do not take a rejection of a PR personally**. I appreciate for your contribution but I reserve the right to be the final arbiter for any changes. You're free to fork my work and tailor it for your needs, it's fine!

Thank you for your interest.
